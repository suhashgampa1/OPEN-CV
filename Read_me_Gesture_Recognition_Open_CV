# Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV

A real-time computer vision application that detects and counts fingers using skin-color segmentation and convexity defects. This project captures video from a webcam, processes the frames in an HSV color space, and identifies the gesture based on the geometry of the hand.

## 🚀 Features
* **Real-time Detection:** Processes video frames instantly from your webcam.
* **Skin Segmentation:** Uses HSV masking to isolate the hand from the background.
* **Geometric Analysis:** Utilizes Convex Hull and Convexity Defects to identify finger counts.
* **Visual Feedback:** Overlays the detected gesture name and geometric contours on the live feed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python 3.11+**
* **OpenCV:** For image processing and computer vision.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array manipulation.

## 📸 How it Works
1. **Region of Interest (ROI):** The script focuses on a specific square on the screen to improve performance.
2. **Filtering:** Applies Gaussian Blur and Dilation to reduce noise in the skin mask.
3. **Contour Mapping:** Finds the largest contour (the hand) and draws a convex hull around it.
4. **Defect Calculation:** Measures the "valleys" between fingers. The number of defects correlates to the number of fingers extended.

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage
